1. Introduction
   
    The Product Catalog System is a backend application built using Spring Boot that provides a 
    RESTful API for managing a catalog of products. This document provides an overview of the 
    system architecture, technologies used, database schema, RESTful API endpoints, deployment 
    instructions, and concluding remarks.
   
2. System Architecture 

  The system follows a simple architecture where Spring Boot serves as the backend, providing 
  RESTful API endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete and search)  operations on 
  product data. There is no frontend component included in this implementation. 
  
3. Technologies Used 

  • Backend: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate ORM 
  • Database: MySQL 
  • Postman : API development environment for testing and debugging API endpoints. 

4. Database Schema 
The database schema includes the following tables:
